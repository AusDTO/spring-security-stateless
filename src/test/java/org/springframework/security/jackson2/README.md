# Jackson serialization

Tests for Jackson 2.x JSON serialization of some Spring Security objects.

Some classes in this package were taken from [pull request #3812](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/pull/3812) sent to [spring-projects/spring-security](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security) by [Jitendra Singh Bisht](https://github.com/jeetmp3) addressing [issue #3736](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/3736).

Once the pull request makes in into the Spring Security libraries, this package becomes redundant.
